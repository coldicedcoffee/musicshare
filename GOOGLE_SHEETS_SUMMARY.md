### ✅ New Features Added:

   - Real-time sync between app and spreadsheet
   - Beautifully formatted spreadsheet with headers

2. **Dual Mode Support**

## 🚀 Current Status

**Server is RUNNING** on port 3000

**Mode**: Memory-only (Google Sheets not configured yet)

The app is **fully functional** right now! Songs work perfectly, they just won't persist after restart until you set up Google Sheets.

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Without Google Sheets (Current Mode):
```
User adds song → Stored in memory → Real-time sync to all users
⚠️ Data lost on restart
```

### With Google Sheets (After Setup):
```
User adds song → Stored in memory + Google Sheets → Real-time sync to all users
✅ Data persists forever!
```

   - Enable Google Sheets API
   - Create service account
   - Download credentials.json
   - Create a Google Sheet
   - Share sheet with service account

   ```

4. **Restart the server**:

## 📋 What Gets Stored in Google Sheets

When configured, your Google Sheet will have these columns:

| ID | Title | Artist | Album | Duration | Added By | Added At |
|----|-------|--------|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| abc-123 | Song Name | Artist Name | Album | 3:45 | Username | 2025-10-15... |

The header row is automatically formatted with a nice blue background and white text!
